# Overview
Pairwise relationships are prevalent in real life. For example, friendships between people, communication links between computers and pairwise similarity of cars. A way to represent a group of relationships is using networks, which consists of a set of nodes and edges. The entities in question are represented as the nodes and the pairwise relations as the edges. 
In real data, often there are missing edges between nodes. This can be due to a bug or deficiency in the data collection process, the lack of resources to collect all pairwise relations or simply there is uncertainty about those relationships. Analysis performed on incomplete networks with missing edges can bias the final output, e.g., if we want to find the shortest path between two cities in a road network, but we are missing information of major highways between these cities, then no algorithm will not be able to find this actual shortest path.
Furthermore, we might want to predict if an edge will form between two nodes in the future. For example, in
a disease transmission network, if health authorities determine a high likelihood of a transmission edge forming between an infected and uninfected person, then the authorities might wish to vaccinate the uninfected person.
Hence, being able to predict and correct for missing edges is an important task.

## Task
In this project, you will be learning from a training network and trying to predict whether edges exist among
test node pairs.

The training network is a partial crawl of the *Twitter social network* from several years ago. The nodes in the network--Twitter users--have been given randomly assigned IDs, and a directed edge from node A to B represents that user A follows B. The training network is a subgraph of the entire network. Starting from several random seed nodes, we proceeded to obtain the friends of the seeds, then their friends' friends, and so on for several iterations.

The test data is a list of 2,000 edges, and your task is to predict if each of those test edges are really edges in the Twitter network or are fake ones. 1,000 of these test edges are real and withheld from the training network, while the other 1,000 do not actually exist.

# Data Format
All data will be available in raw text. The training graph data will given in a (tab delimited) adjacency edge
list format, where each row represents a node and its out neighbours (users being followed by that node). For
example:
1 2
2 3
4 3 5 1

The test edge set is in a (tab-delimited) edge list format also, where each represents an edge (source node, target node). Given this 2,000-row edge list, your implemented algorithm should take the test list in and return a 2,001 row CSV file that has a) in the first row, the header string "Id,Predictions"; b) in all subsequent rows, an ID integer representing row number (1 through 2000), a comma, then a oat in the range [0,1]. These oats are your "guesses" or predictions as to whether the corresponding test edge was from the Twitter network or
not. Higher predictions correspond to being more confident that the edge is real.

For example, given the test edge set of:
3 1
3 4

if your prediction probabilities are 0.1 for edge (3,1) and 0.99 for edge (3,4) is true, then your output file should be as follows:
Id,Predictions
1,0.1
2,0.99
